stocks,NVDA,"Nvidia Surges Past Microsoft, US Markets Climb on Strong Economic Data",117,2025-06-03 23:35:40,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1l2qwzx/nvidia_surges_past_microsoft_us_markets_climb_on/,"Just looking at today's market action, the Dow, S&P 500 and Nasdaq are all up nicely, with the Nasdaq leading the way, up about 0.8%. Small caps were also nimble, with the Russell 2000 up about 1.5%.

But what were the real headlines? NVIDIA's market capitalization soared to $3.444 trillion, officially surpassing Microsoft's $3.441 trillion to become the world's most valuable company. The demand for artificial intelligence chips is clearly exciting investors.

What do you think?Does Nvidia's rise signal that the AI boom will drive tech stocks higher? Or is this a peak moment before a pullback? Also, with tariffs still a concern in the OECD report, can these gains hold?"
stocks,CRWD,CrowdStrike shares drop on weak revenue guidance,21,2025-06-04 04:22:28,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1l2whps/crowdstrike_shares_drop_on_weak_revenue_guidance/,"CrowdStrike shares fell about 5% in extended trading on Tuesday after the security software maker issued a weaker-than-expected revenue forecast. The company reported revenue of $1.1 billion (in-line with expectations) and adjusted earnings per share of 73 cents (versus 65 cents expected).

Revenue increased nearly 20% in the fiscal first quarter, which ended on April 30, according to a statement. The company registered a net loss of $110.2 million, or 44 cents per share, compared with net income of $42.8 million, or 17 cents per share, in the same quarter last year. 

For the current quarter, CrowdStrike called for 82 cents to 84 cents in adjusted earnings per share on $1.14 billion to $1.15 billion in revenue. Analysts polled by LSEG were expecting 81 cents in earnings per share and $1.16 billion in revenue.

CrowdStrike bumped up its guidance for full-year earnings but maintained its expectation for revenue. The company now sees $3.44 to $3.56 in adjusted earnings per share, with $4.74 billion to $4.81 billion in revenue. The LSEG consensus was $3.43 per share and $4.77 billion in revenue. The earnings guidance provided in March was $3.33 to $3.45 in adjusted earnings per share.

stocks,CRWD,CrowdStrike drops 6.7% on weak Q2 forecast amid soft tech spending,100,2025-06-03 20:57:16,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1l2n6sk/crowdstrike_drops_67_on_weak_q2_forecast_amid/,"No paywall: [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/crowdstrike-forecasts-second-quarter-revenue-201949980.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/crowdstrike-forecasts-second-quarter-revenue-201949980.html)

(Reuters) -CrowdStrike forecast second-quarter revenue below Wall Street estimates, signaling soft enterprise spending on cybersecurity products, sending the company's shares down 6.7% after the bell on Tuesday.

Higher interest rates and sticky inflation have forced clients to rein in tech spending, weighing on demand for companies such as CrowdStrike, despite an increasing need for robust cybersecurity solutions due to rising threats and ransomware attacks.

The Department of Government Efficiency's efforts to cut costs could negatively impact the cybersecurity forecast for 2025 as the U.S. federal, state and local government contract environment appears to be significantly more challenging, brokerage William Blair said in April.

Tariffs and macroeconomic uncertainty are likely to influence future client spending, the brokerage added.

CrowdStrike also faces stiff competition from other cybersecurity firms including Palo Alto Networks and Fortinet.

CrowdStrike reported total revenue of $1.10 billion in the first quarter, in line with expectations.

The company forecast second-quarter revenue to be between $1.14 billion and $1.15 billion, compared with analysts' average estimate of $1.16 billion, according to data compiled by LSEG.

CrowdStrike's board also approved a share repurchase program of up to $1 billion on Tuesday."
investing,CRWD,"Sold CRWD before earnings, what entry point to buy back?",2,2025-06-04 12:31:04,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1l34brl/sold_crwd_before_earnings_what_entry_point_to_buy/,"Sold 50 shares @ $472 because I strongly suspected it would drop after earnings.

I do believe the stock will go into the thousands by 2030 but also has strong momentum and swings. Hoping to capture some of these swings by selling at highs and rebuying more shares at lows so I can expand how many shares I have without putting in earned income (and then just selling a few shares come tax season to pay off capital gains). 

If I buy at market open, looks like I’ll be able to buy 52 shares with the proceeds of the 50 I sold (gain of 2 shares). Or should I get greedy and wait for a lower entry point?"
wallstreetbets,^GSPC,Any near-term weakness in the S&P 500 will provide a “buy-low” opportunity,30,2025-06-04 13:59:13,https://i.redd.it/dpa4z88e2x4f1.png,"JP Morgan analysts said in a report on Wednesday, although the recent stock market rally has weakened, but any short-term pullback in large-cap stocks should be regarded as a “buy low” opportunity.

JP Morgan wrote: “Since mid-May, the stock market rally has either decelerated or stalled. Relevant signals increase the likelihood of a near-term price pullback.”

However, analysts at the bank still maintain a bullish stance on large-cap stocks, pointing to a strong medium-term trend.

JPMorgan says: “As long as the S&P 500 stays above the key 5600 level, the medium-term bullish outlook will continue.”

The bank added that large-cap leadership remains intact, “and we suspect that any short-term weakness in large-cap stocks will provide a ‘buy-low’ opportunity before testing cycle highs sometime this summer.”

JPMorgan also pointed to signs of weakness in cyclical sectors of the market, noting that the Russell 2000, materials and energy sectors have stalled near key resistance levels.

The firm added, “Commodity price action has reinforced signals in these two sectors.” And it singled out DuPont (NYSE: DD) and EOG Resources (NYSE: EOG) as examples of weaker allocations in both groups.

Conversely, JPMorgan noted that the healthcare sector would be a potential bright spot if the broader market weakens. “We also see the battered healthcare sector as an interesting long opportunity,” the analysts wrote, noting recent buy signals as well as near support levels. Bristol-Myers Squibb (NYSE:BMY) is rated as an “attractive structure and chart pattern” stock."
